# Algorithms
Collection of algorithms or things I want to learn and can learn a little better if I can code them.

This is ultimately just a practice space to help me learn these things. A lot of this code is incomplete but I hope to slowly develop it. I'd also like to be able to code these up in different languages... but that might be a ways off.

__Stuff I want to learn__:

  - Balanced Search Tree (B-Tree),
  - Binary Search Tree (BST),
  - Linked Lists,
  - Anagrams,
  - Pangrams,
  - Traveling Sales Person,
  - Knapsack Problem,
  - Hill Climbing,
  - Primality,
  - Gaus-Newton & Newton Optimization,
  - Maximum a Posterior & Expectation Maximization,
  - Page Rank
